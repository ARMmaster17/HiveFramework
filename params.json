{"name":"Hive Framework","tagline":"Programming language aimed towards parallel computing","body":"# What is Hive Framework\r\nThe Hive Framework is a light-weight framework upon which you can build your own cluster computing program with no knowledge of how the Hive is set up or the underlying OS. All Hive apps are built in the Hivil language, which is kinda like BASIC (remember that?). The Hive Framework is also completely driven on auto-pilot. Just install it on a server, plug it into your network, and you're done! Hive takes care of connecting to other Hive nodes and syncing its status across the network. It's also intelligent enough to balance the workload if the current node is faster (or slower) than the other nodes in the Hive.\r\n\r\n# How do I get it?\r\n**DISCLAIMER: HIVE FRAMEWORK IS NOT FINISHED. STABILITY IS NOT GUARANTEED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**\r\n\r\nClick one of the buttons above to download the latest version. Upon finishing, extract the files to your computer. Next install the latest version of Ruby. Then simply run the Ruby program *HiveStart.rb*. That's it! If you would like a more configurable setup procedure, check out the book listed below.\r\n\r\n# System Requirements\r\n## Minimum\r\nYou probably could go lower, but here's what we tested Hive on while we developed it (operating at a reasonable speed)\r\n- Intel Pentium III 800 MHz (1 Core)\r\n- 256 MB DDR RAM\r\n- SSH Access\r\n- Debian Linux 7.x i386\r\n- Latest version of Ruby\r\n- Ethernet\r\n\r\n## Recommended\r\nThis is what our build server consisted of. This would probably be the best option for most non-enterprise users.\r\n- Intel Hex Core\r\n- 8 GB RAM\r\n- SSH Access\r\n- Docker\r\n- Ubuntu 13.04 x86_64\r\n- Latest version of Ruby\r\n- Ethernet\r\n\r\n## Optimum\r\nHere's what we recommend for more serious/enterprise users\r\n- Intel Xeon (1 CPU, Quad or better)\r\n- 4 GB RAM\r\n- SSH/VNC Access\r\n- Latest version of i686 or x86_64 Linux (Any distro that runs Ruby)\r\n- Latest version of Ruby\r\n- Dual Ethernet (Load distribution or fail-safe mode)\r\n\r\n**HIVE Framework will also work on Windows and Mac OS X, but you may need to modify your scripts for full functionality.*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
